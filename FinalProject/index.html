      <h1>The Shipping Forecast</h1>
      <p>The year 1816 is known as the Year Without a Summer because of severe climate abnormalities that caused average global temperatures to decrease by 0.4–0.7 °C (0.7–1.3 °F). It led to unusually spectacular sunsets and were an inspiration for some of J. M. W. Turner's work.</p>
      <p>In October 1859, the steam clipper Royal Charter was wrecked in a strong storm off Anglesey; 450 people lost their lives. Due to this loss, Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy introduced a warning service for shipping in February 1861, using telegraph communications.</p>
      <p>Commissioned in 2003 for The Unilever Series in the Turbine Hall at the Tate Modern, 'The weather project' tells of the climate and of its social effects. Visitors who stepped in from the rigours of the London winter found themselves facing a dazzling sun, shining out into a setting almost devoid of colour, its outlines blurred by mist.</p>
